# Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp
This repository is based on the online classes I did with Udemy to leverage Python to solve Data Science problems. 
The instructor Jose Portilla, a Data Scientist himself lectured the course which is worth taking.
I will only post the iPython notebooks and they will be posted as I finish them myself. This helps me to keep a track of my studies
and also refer to it on the fly while I am at work.
